### todo

* implement BidFetcherLoom just using a dumb ExecutorService with a shutdown/wait
    - see ~/gists_java/vthread*/eg2

### ok 

* X - does this use the remote strategy?

### notes

* looks like StructuredExecutor was renamed to StructuredTaskScope and is in incubation
    - https://github.com/openjdk/loom/blob/fibers/src/jdk.incubator.concurrent/share/classes/jdk/incubator/concurrent/StructuredTaskScope.java
